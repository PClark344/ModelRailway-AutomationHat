# ModelRailway-AutomationHat
Python Programs to run the Pimoroni Automation Hat for the Raspberry Pi with a Model Railway 

To detect the position of a model train on a model layout, to change colour light signals accordingly, and to stop train if necessary at Red Signal. 

These programs are used with the Pimoroni Mini Automation Hat and with its modules. Input is from a Light Dependant Resistor Detector. Output can be to a circuit board for the colour light signal or to relay on the mini Automation Hat to stop or start trains.
